Fantasy Football Platform Case Study
This project is a Fantasy Football Platform implemented with Django and Django REST Framework. It provides features for user registration, team and player management, player transfers, and transaction history, along with JWT authentication.

Features
User Registration and Management: Users can register and manage their profiles.
Team Management:
On user registration, a team is automatically created with an initial capital and 20 randomly generated players assigned to it (including goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and attackers).
Player Management:
Players can be listed for sale by specifying a sale price.
Players marked as "for sale" can be transferred to another team.
Transfer Market:
Players listed for sale can be purchased by other teams if they have enough capital.
A player's value may increase randomly after a transfer, adding a dynamic aspect to the game.
Transaction History:
Keeps track of all player transfers, including the buyer, seller, and transfer amount.
JWT Authentication:
Utilizes Django REST Framework's Simple JWT for secure user authentication.
Project Structure
The project follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) inspired approach to structure the code in a way that separates concerns and makes it more maintainable. This includes services for business logic, repositories for data access, and views for API handling.

Key Components
Models:

Team: Represents a team with players and manages total value updates.
Player: Represents individual players with attributes like position, value, and availability for sale.
Transaction: Tracks player transfer transactions.
Services:

Encapsulates business logic such as listing players for sale or transferring players between teams.
Repositories:

Handles data access and manipulation for the main entities.
Views:

Uses Django REST Frameworkâ€™s APIView and generics to implement the REST API endpoints.

Testing: Pytest
Domain-Driven Design Inspired Structure
The code follows a DDD-inspired structure to separate concerns:

Services layer: Encapsulates business logic for use cases.
Repositories layer: Responsible for data access logic.
Views layer: Manages request handling and response formatting.
